Intro: C - Em - Am - F G  (2x)

C                    Em
Once she came like a vision in the night
Am                        F
I fell in love before the morning arrived
Am                       F
She wore a blue dress to combat the heat
C                              G
Drank beer from the bottle and danced in the street
C
Then I heard her singing something fairly familiar
Em
A tale of two lovers in the thick of the summer
Am                         F
And there in the moment we kissed in the hammock
C                    G                      Am            F
We argued over which Bad Religion album was better 
C             G             Am       F         C        G
I said "No Control" or "Suffer"

     C                       Em
Then she became queen of the neighborhood parties
      Am                    F
While I was an unknown boy along for the ride
Am              F
Kept the guitar right by my side
C                                      G
It was better than conversing with the kids I didn't like
           C
But on the fourth of July when the fireworks rang out
    Em
She met a new boy who was more hip and less strung out
Am                F
I drove home with fire in the sky 
C                          G               Am            F
Fiddled with the dials and stumbled across something
C                 G       Am        F          C          G
    That you were always humming

   Am             C                       F
As time tables suggest, we were only just friends
            Em       G        Am
In constant motions covering stilts
(Am)            C                       F
I'll give you a dollar for another ride home
   Em                                 E
Or something to mix with your coke

     C                           Em                  Am
Well maybe if you want to wander around outside tonight
(Am)               F         G     
Meet me in Lake Ariel after midnight
    C                  Em       
Or really whenever, I only want to talk
  Am                           G
I only want to relive what was lost


   Am             C                       F
As time tables suggest, we were only just friends
            Em       G        Am
In constant motions covering stilts
(Am)            C                       F
I'll give you a dollar for another ride home
   Em           G             
Or something to mix with your...


   C              G                       Am
As time tables suggest, we were only just friends
            F        G        C
In constant motions covering stilts
(C)              G                  Am     
I'll give you a dollar for another ride home
    F           G              C
Or something to mix with your coke
