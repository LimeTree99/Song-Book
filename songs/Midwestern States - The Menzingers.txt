Capo 3
[Intro]

G G/B C D (x2)

[Verse]

G           G/B             C
I hope this isn't a burden
            D             G
Thanks for having us over
              G/B
We could sleep on the couch
               C
We could sleep on the floor
          D                    Em
We would leave before you even noticed we were here
      D            C   G
Even notice us at all

[Verse]

G           G/B                        C
Been having problems with our landlord
              D                      G
He said he's taking us both to court
            G/B
She got her hours slashed
        C              D             G
And my unemployment's drying up fast
            G/B                C
We both got worthless diplomas 
      D                 G                
from worthless universities
    G/B                      C
Two bachelor's in worthless studies
                 D               Em
But at least it made our parents happy
                         D
And cost a whole lot of money

[Chorus]

         G                         
You said LA's only two days 
       C 
if we drive straight, Denver if we get tired
          G
Said you didn't mind stopping 
                                   C
Just as long as we got out of the midwest states 
        G
The midwestern states
        G
The midwestern states
        G
The midwestern states
        G
The midwestern states

[Verse]

G    
But I know somewhere in Chicago where we can stay for a little
N.C.
I hope this isn't a burden
                          G
Thanks for having us over
               G/B                    C           D              G
Most nights we always fall asleep with something dumb on Netflix
            G/B               C                D                   G
Some nights trash reality or kids cartoons or shitty documentaries
                      G/B           C
Not perfect but we're good together
                       D           G 
Yeah, me, you, and our bad tattoos
              G/B                       C
Yeah, all our stick and pokes, all our inside jokes
         D                            Em
We'll regret them when we're dead and sober
                 D                            C
But we're still breathing and the party ain't over

[Chorus]

         G                         
You said LA's only two days 
       C 
if we drive straight, Denver if we get tired
          G
Said you didn't mind stopping 
                                   C
Just as long as we got out of the midwest states 
         G                         
You said LA's only two days 
       C 
if we drive straight, Denver if we get tired
          G
Said you didn't mind stopping 
                                   C
Just as long as we got out of the midwest states 
        G
The midwestern states
        G
The midwestern states
        G
The midwestern states
        G
The midwestern states
        G
The midwestern states
