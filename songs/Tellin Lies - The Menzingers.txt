[Intro]

A Bm D

[Verse]

A                  Bm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, everything is terrible
      D                          A
When buying marijuana makes you feel like a criminal
      A                      Bm
When your new friends take a joke too literal
D                         A
Making you feel like the bad guy
A         Bm
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
D                  A
Where are we gonna go
A         Bm
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
D                          A
now that our twenties are over?
A                 Bm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, all hope abandoned
     D                  A
I'm not young enough to be a companion
A                 Bm
Not old enough to be a guide
        D               A
What a cliche, time to try
A         Bm
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
D                  A
Where are we gonna go
A         Bm
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
D                          A
now that our twenties are over?

[Chorus]

D
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
A
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
D
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
A
Everyone's asking me over and over
D                          A
The decade taken hostage by my own guilty conscience
D
When you gonna quit this nonsense?
A
Everyone's asking me over and over
   F#m
But I
A/G#  A     D      Bm
don't mind telling lies

[Interlude]

A Bm D A (x2)

[Verse]

A                      Bm
So, oh yeah, oh yeah, let's go to Vegas
        D                    A
Put it all on black and get married by Elvis
       A              Bm
If we wake up broke, we'll be fine
D                   A
We'll get rich in another lifetime
A         Bm
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
D                  A
Where are we gonna go
A         Bm
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
D                          A
now that our twenties are over?

[Chorus]

D
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
A
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
D
Where are we gonna go now that our twenties are over?
A
Everyone's asking me over and over
D                          A
The decade taken hostage by my own guilty conscience
D
When you gonna quit this nonsense?
A
Everyone's asking me over and over
   F#m
But I
A/G#  A     D      Bm
don't mind telling lies

[Bridge]

      D
Like tension you can cut with a knife
        A
Like a wedding ring that never fit right
        D
Like a car alarm that won't stop howling
   A                 A/G#       F#m
A decade lost in the motions to romance and cheap whiskey
     A
The subtle sound of a fleeting feeling
     F#m
Like four chords that don't love you no more
      A
In a motel room, a sleeping bag on the floor
       D
Is it wrong to say that things can change?
       A
Is it wrong to say that things can change?
       D
Is it wrong to say that things can change?
       A
Is it wrong to say that things can change?
       D
Is it wrong to say that things can change?
       A
Is it wrong to say that things can change?
       D
Is it wrong to say that things can change?
       A                           A/G# F#m
Is it wrong to say that things can change?
