Coming clean – green day

A#                             Gm
Seventeen and strung out on confusion
A#                            Gm
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
F                                D#
I found out what it takes to be a man
F                               D#
Now Mom and Dad will never understand

A#                                Gm
Secrets collecting dust but never forget
A#                           Gm
Skeletons come to life in my closet
F                                 D#
I found out what it takes to be a man
F                               D#
Now Mom and Dad will never Understand

What's happening to me?

Seventeen and coming clean for the first time
A#                                   Gm
I finally figured out myself for the first time
F                                 D#
I found out what it takes to be a man
F                               D#
Now Mom and Dad will never understand
                    A#
What's happening to me?
