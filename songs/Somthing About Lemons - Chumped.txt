capo 2

[Verse 1]
               D#5      A#        B
My heart beats mi-i-i-i-iles from here
C#m
In a town where everybody stays
A
'Cause no one has the will to change
D#5            D#5       A#       B
And I'm losing gro-o-o-o-ound, my dear
C#m
In the footsteps of an empty dream
A
I thought would save the world for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And every day, I grow a little more resentful
B
Of the choices that I did or didn't make
Wanted this to feel a little more eventful
Every day that I'm awake just feels the same
It feels the same

[Chorus]
You keep saying there's a way out
I keep searching but I haven't found the key
We're all running from our problems
Not going anywhere we really wanna be
We wanna be

[Verse 2]
Don't let them shame you, dear
For trying to make lemonade
From shit they deal you every day
And you need some change this year
Go make decisions for yourself
Instead of everybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, every day you grow a little more resentful
Of the chances that you did or didn't take
Wanted this to feel a little more eventful
Every day that you're awake just feels the same
It feels the same

[Chorus]
You keep saying there's a way out
I keep searching but I haven't found the key
We're all running from our problems
Not going anywhere we really wanna be
We wanna be

You keep saying there's a way out
I keep searching but I haven't found the key
We're all running from our problems
Not going anywhere we really wanna be
We wanna be
