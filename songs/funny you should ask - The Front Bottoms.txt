[Verse]
    C                    Am            Em            F
The good thing about this cast is I can still hold a knife
          C            Am                Em                F          
So if you ever twist my arm again I'll be sure to put up a fight
          C               Am                 Em             F
You see I just don't wanna do the things that you want me to do
          C            Am                Em                 F
But I'm a sucker, so I do them cause I am still in love with you

[Pre-Chorus]
         F              G         Am      F          G       Am
She said "Honey, y'gotta learn that love is simple just like mud.
                F                       G       Am      F       G
If you play the dirt, then I'll play the water. All we gotta do is touch"

[Chorus]
            C                Em               G           D 
Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anything
      C               Em        G       D
But I'm older now and know that I should
            C                Em               G          D
Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anything
    C                Em           G      D
But I'm older now and know that I should

[Verse]
       C                 Am            Em            F
It is freezing and I am watching you shovel snow 
      C                Am            Em            F
Off a driveway across from my parent's home
         C                    Am            Em            F
Now it's summer (now it's summer) and you are laying out on your lawn
            C                 Am            Em            F
You look so sexy, Chelsea, with your polka dot bikini on

[Pre-Chorus]
          F                     G        
Come on, Chelsea, speak a little French to me
Am              F                           G
Heard you spent two whole semesters drinking wine
        Am           F                         G
While I was stuck in Jersey trying to save some money
  Am              F               G
I guess I'm just another thing you left behind

[Chorus]
             C                Em               G           D 
But you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
     C                Em               G           D 
But you're older now and wish that you could
             C                Em               G           D 
But you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
     C                Em               G           
But you're older now and wish that you could

[Bridge 1]
                      C
It's funny you should ask
Em                F     G
   Cause I don't remember
                      C
It's funny you should ask

Thought you got the best of me turns out it was a video
          C                      Am
Me and my best friend, me and my cousins
              G                        F
Sitting there smiling turns out it was a video

[Chorus]
             C                Em               G           D 
But I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anyone
    C                Em               G           D 
But I'm older now and know that I should
           C                Em               G           D 
Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anyone
   C                Em               G           D 
But I'm older now and know that I should

[Bridge 3]
                      C
It's funny you should ask
Em                F     G
   Cause I don't remember
                      C
It's funny you should ask
Em                F       G
   I coulda been a contender
                      C
It's funny you should ask
Em                F       G
   No, I will not surrender
                      C
It's funny you should ask
Em               F      G
   Cause I don't remember
