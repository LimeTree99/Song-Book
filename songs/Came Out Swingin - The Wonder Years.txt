Moved all my shit into my parent's basement
    F
And out of our old apartment
   Am                          G
I know things changed but I'm not sure when
   C
I guess you'd call this regression
          F
I left a real job and a girlfriend
      Am                     G
I convinced myself that I'm brave enough for all of this
 Dm                  F            C
Well, I spent this whole year in airports
          G               Dm   Am  F  C
And the floor feels like home, woh-oh-oh
                 G    Dm   
At least we're never alone
         F           C                  G            Dm   Am  F  C
I lost track of the time zones and I'd call but you know, woh-oh-oh


                 F
I'm running on empty
     C                   G                    F
The late nights and the long drives start to get to me

I'm just so tired


              F          C            G
I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure what I'm looking for
        F          C              G
I'm a voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
   F
I came in here alone
         C
Came in here alone
                   G
But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago
              F          C            G
I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure where home is anymore

F  C  G

            C
Been on a steady fast food diet
       F                       Am
Like we're this generation's Morgan Spurlock
         G
But we don't admit defeat
    C                         F
My body feels rejected and I can't say that I blame it
    Am
My heart keeps saying stay young
     G
My lower back seems to disagree
    Dm        F             C            G          Dm   Am  F  C
I unrolled a cheap cotton blanket on an old dirty couch, woh-oh-oh
            G             Dm
I felt the year start to wind down
          F        C
I can't stand any dead space
       G          Dm   Am  F  C
Empty beds bum me out, woh-oh-oh


              F          C            G
I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure what I'm looking for

   C                         F
I came out swinging from a South Philly basement
          Am                         G
Caked in stale beer and sweat under half-lit fluorescents
        C                       F
And I spent the winter writing songs about getting better
    Am                         G
And if I'm being honest, I'm getting there
